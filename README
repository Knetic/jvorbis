JVorbis
==

This library enables use of the Tremor branch of Ogg Vorbis in Java applications.

Ogg Vorbis (if you didn't already know) is an audio compression format which is license-free and open-source.
This library ties itself specifically to the Tremor branch of Ogg Vorbis, which is a faster (fixed-point)
implementation of the specification. This makes this library well-suited for embedded applications.
