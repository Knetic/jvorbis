JVorbis
==

This library enables use of the Tremor branch of Ogg Vorbis in Java applications.

Ogg Vorbis (if you didn't already know) is an audio compression format which is license-free and open-source.
Unfortunately, Vorbis doesn't have any officially-supported wrappers for Java. This library aims to provide support for that.

This library ties itself specifically to the Tremor branch of Ogg Vorbis, which is a faster (fixed-point) implementation of the specification. This makes this library well-suited for embedded applications.

Building
==

Just run "build.sh". It will output a libvorbis.so file, as well as a JVorbisFile.class. These two files should be all that's necessary to get support for Vorbis into your system.

Run the sample
==

Included is a "VorbTest.java", which is a sample that shows the basic usage of the library. You can run it from the "sampleTest.sh" file.
